**`Aspiring Software Engineer`**

I'm a recent graduate with a bachelors degree in Computer Science with a focus on front-end, back-end, and game development. Throughout my studies, I have learned a lot about how to be a better problem solver, programmer, and team-player. Here you can see all of my coding projects that I have personally had a significant hand in development. These projects range from filling in important pieces of already established code to full applications built from scratch. There is still so much to be learned on my journey as a software engineer and I hope to improve my skills as time goes on.

### 😃 About Me 😃
* 🎓 I've graduated from California State University of Fullerton with a Bachelors in Computer Science
* 🖥️ When it comes to technology, I love trying to figure out how something works. Overcoming brain-teasing obstacles has become my passion in life, and in the world of software engineering, I believe I can explore that passion to the fullest extent.
* 🎮 When I'm not coding or solving problems at work, I am a game enthusiast. I especially love tactics games such as XCOM, Divinity, and Fire Emblem for their ability to immerse the player by having them make important decisions to keep your party alive. My favorite game, however, would have to be Elden Ring for its absolutely stellar gameplay, art, and lore that make the world feel alive.

  <summary><h4>🏃 Finding My Passion in Technology 🏃</h4></summary>
  My journey ultimately begins in 7th grade where all middle schoolers were required to take a STEM class. Being so young, I had no idea or foresight into what I wanted to do when I grew up, my teacher for that class changed that. We were introduced to problems that required not guidelines or formulas, but creativity to solve. It was then that I had the ability to play with Scratch, a beginners programming platform, and I fell in love. Seeing the fruits of my labor output as a mini fighting game had me settled on what I wanted to be, a programmer. Once I entered highschool, it was hard to get into a computer science course given I wasn't a member of the tech division for my school, but I was eventually able to find a spot in one of the classes. There I had officially solidified my decision to become a software engineer, as my passion had not waned. College begins and thus my skills as a problem solver were really put to the test. I struggled in the beginning as the information needed to be a software engineer was a lot to take in, but I pushed through. Fast forward 4 years and I'm now graduated, it was definitely not easy, but thats what made the work worth it. To this day my passion as a software engineer stands tall, and I hope through my next opportunity as a full-time devloper that I can further develop this passion.
